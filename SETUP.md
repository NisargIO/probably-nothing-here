hi! this is a super secret project we've been working on. it's a React linter for performance that helps you find rerender issues + explains why they're happening.

this should take <5 min to setup :)

## 0. prerequisites

clone this repo onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NisargIO/probably-nothing-here.git
```

## 1. install vscode extension

i should have sent you a file called million-lint-0.0.x.vsix. install that onto your vscode by dragging it into your extensions sidebar tab (<kbd>Cmd âŒ˜ + Shift â‡§ + X</kbd>)

<img src="./assets/installing-extension.gif" width="450" />

reload your vscode window (or restart it) to make sure the extension is installed.

## 2. open dev environment

go to this repo:

```bash
cd probably-nothing-here
```

then run:

```bash
cd notes-demo
npm install
npm run start
```

then open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## 3. try it out!

play around with the app and see if you can find any performance issues. if you do, you should see it in the "Problems" tab in vscode.

_**hint**: try the `NoteButton` component_

here's how i use it:
